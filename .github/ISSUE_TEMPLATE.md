Please only report one bug or make one enhancement request per issue - this makes it easier to track individual changes.

If Radio Downloader gives you the option to report an error, please send it and then include the error report number in this issue.

Also, remember to give plenty of info - good examples would be:
- The steps to reproduce a crash
- A podcast feed url that fails to work
- The full name of episodes that are failing

Don't forget to include the exact error message (if you are getting one), and a screenshot can also be useful.
